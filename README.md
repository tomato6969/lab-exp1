Experiment No. 1

Aim:

To install and set up Visual Studio Code for C++ programming, and to implement:

1.A simple "Hello World" program.

2.A basic calculator program in C++.

Tools Required:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Theory:

In this experiment, you learn to set up a basic C++ programming environment using Visual Studio Code.

The Hello World program is a simple starting point that demonstrates the basic syntax of a C++ program including:

a)Preprocessor directives

b)main() function

c)Output using cout

The Calculator Program demonstrates:

a)Taking input using cin

b)Performing basic arithmetic operations (like addition)

c)Displaying results using cout

d)Use of operators and conditional statements (if extended)

Key C++ Concepts:

#include: Includes the standard I/O stream.

using namespace std;: Avoids using std:: repeatedly.

int main(): Entry point of the program.

cout, cin: Output and input streams respectively.

Conclusion:

By performing this experiment:

You have successfully set up a C++ development environment on your system.

You have understood and implemented the structure of a basic C++ program.

You have learned how to write and execute simple programs including output and user input handling using VS Code.
